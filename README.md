# ✅ Passed AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer Associate) – Resources, Tips & Practice Tests

Just passed the **AZ-500 exam** and wanted to share my prep journey in case it helps others. It’s a security-focused exam that dives deep into Azure RBAC, identity protection, platform security, networking, encryption, and governance. Not just definitions — you’re tested on how to **secure and monitor real-world Azure environments**.

I started with Microsoft Learn (free official path) and a few YouTube walkthroughs for areas like conditional access and Defender for Cloud. But honestly, the **Skillcertpro practice tests** made the biggest difference. I got **75–80% questions that were very close** to what I saw in the actual exam — especially the scenario-based ones around **IAM, Azure Policies, NSGs/ASGs, Key Vaults, Defender for Cloud**, and **monitoring with Log Analytics**.

I prepped for around 3–4 weeks:  
- **Week 1–2**: Microsoft Learn + hands-on in Azure Portal  
- **Week 3–4**: Focused mock tests, revised wrong answers, and went through the cheat sheet before the exam

If you’re planning for AZ-500, don’t just memorize — understand how to **configure, monitor, and secure resources in Azure**, especially across multiple services.
